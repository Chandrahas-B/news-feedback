Selvi ends up spending approximately 22 percent of her monthly income of INR 10,000 on accessing basic infrastructural facilities. Out of this, a significant amount is spent on daily repairs to enable the delivery of water. This includes expenses for the regular maintenance of the Cauvery water grid and local borewell water grids, which constitutes the repair of water pumps and leakages on the pipelines. On the days when regular water supply is disrupted, Selvi bears the additional costs of the water tanker and water ATMs. She incurs similar expenses for regular fixing of the sewerage system, the electricity system, and the drainage system in her neighbourhood. The other, often hidden and unpredictable, factor is the time required to organise the people and the systems for repair and how this affects Selvi\u2019s ability to complete her household duties in time to get her children to school and herself to work on time. There are times when she is late or unable to make it to work at all, and she dreads such days that put her at risk of losing her job. For Selvi, and other women residing in similar low-income neighbourhoods, these repair expenses are burdensome in more ways than one.",
